                                                     Overview:-

       In his project we can have explain the women case Analysies and predit to stop the crimes and also we upload a 
       
       dataset. in this dataset we have upload Crime cases in which Area, Time, either cheating or chain snatching helpful
       
       to predit the crime Here offer will held in a particular area it can which type of crime predit to avoid crime.

      • Decision Tree:

       Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems,        but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems.

       In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used to            make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not             contain any further branches
